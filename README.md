# NodeMCU Scripts
> Scripts to power my NodeMCU boards

This is a simple framework to run on a [NodeMCU](https://www.nodemcu.com/) controller.

It provides an easy way to:

- Configure the WiFi.
- Subscribe and publish MQTT messages, handling all the possible errors by reconnecting.

I will probably run multiple NodeMCUs in the future. To make it easier, they
will all receive the same Lua files, but each one will run a specific `app_*.lua`

Which NodeMCU is responsible for what is configured in the `nodenames` table of
[config.lua](/config.lua), the `node.chipid()` is used to figure out where we run.

The [config.lua](/config.lua) also contains some basic setup for the WiFi and the MQTT broker.

Passwords have to be placed in an unversioned `secrets.lua`.
See the [secrets.lua.dist](/secrets.lua.dist) file for a template.

The wifi setup has a `g.wifi.waitThen()` method accepting a callback that will
be run only after an IP address has been assigned. You will probably want to wait
for that before starting the MQTT client.

See [app_balcony.lua](/app_balcony.lua) for an example application. It allows the control of a water
pump via MQTT. However, the pump will not run when the water level is too low.
